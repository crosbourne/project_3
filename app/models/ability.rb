    user ||= User.new 
    # guest user (not logged in)
    # guest user can read all 
    # guest user cannot create, edit, delete 

    # if user.role? :admin

    # elsif user.role? :user
    #   can :read, :all
    #   cannot :create, Genre
    #   cannot :edit, Genre
    #   can :create, Album
    #   can :edit, Album, user_id: user.id
    #   can :destroy, Album, user_id: user.id 
    #   can :create, Song
    #   can :edit, Song, user_id: user.id
    #   can :destroy, Song, user_id: user.id
    #   can :create, Comment 
    #   can :edit, Comment, user_id: user.id
    #   can :destroy, Comment, user_id: user.id 
    #   # cannot comment on own page
    # else

    # end
    #
    # The first argument to `can` is the action you are giving the user
    # permission to do.
    # If you pass :manage it will apply to every action. Other common actions
    # here are :read, :create, :update and :destroy.
    #
    # The second argument is the resource the user can perform the action on.
    # If you pass :all it will apply to every resource. Otherwise pass a Ruby
    # class of the resource.
    #
    # The third argument is an optional hash of conditions to further filter the
    # objects.
    # For example, here the user can only update published articles.
    #
    #   can :update, Article, :published => true
